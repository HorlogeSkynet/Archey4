# Archey 4

![archey4](https://horlogeskynet.github.io/img/blog/the-archey-project-what-i-ve-decided-to-do.png?v4.3.0)

## Why (again) a f*cking new Archey fork ?

The answer is [here](https://horlogeskynet.github.io/archey4).

> Note : Since the 21st September of 2017, you may notice that this repository no longer has the official status of fork.  
> Actually, the maintainer decided to separate it from the original one's "network" with the help of the _GitHub_'s staff.  
> Nevertheless, **this piece of software is still a fork of the [djmelik's Archey project](https://github.com/djmelik/archey.git)**.

## Which packages do I need to run this script ?

### Required packages

* python3
* lsb-release
* procps

### Highly recommended packages

| Environments |  Packages  |                Reasons                | Notes |
| :----------- | :--------: | :-----------------------------------: | :---: |
| All          | `dnsutils`<br>`net-tools` | **WAN_IP** and **LAN_IP** would be detected faster | They will provide `dig` and `hostname` |
| Graphical    |  `pciutils`<br>`wmctrl`  | **GPU** wouldn't be detected without it<br>**WindowManager** would be more accurate | `pciutils` will provide `lspci` |
| Virtual      | `virt-what`<br>`dmidecode` | **Model** would contain details about the hypervisor | `archey` will need to be run as **root** |

## Installation

### Install from package

First, grab a package for your distribution from the latest release [here](https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/archey4/releases/latest).  
Now, it's time to use your favorite packages manager. Some examples :

* Arch-based distributions ([source](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/archey4/))

	```shell
	pacman -U ./archey4-v4.X.Z-R-any.pkg.tar.xz
	```

* Debian-based distributions ([source](https://labs.pixelswap.fr/HorlogeSkynet/archey4-packaging))

	```shell
	apt install ./archey4-4.Y.Z-R-all.deb
	```

* Red Hat, Fedora, OpenSuse, ... ([source](https://labs.pixelswap.fr/HorlogeSkynet/archey4-packaging))

	```shell
	dnf install ./archey4-4.Y.Z-R.noarch.rpm
	```

### Install from source

#### Latest stable release

```shell
$ wget -O archey4.tar.gz https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/archey4/archive/master.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf archey4.tar.gz
$ cd archey4-master/
$ chmod +x archey
$ sudo cp archey /usr/local/bin/archey
```

#### Development version

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/archey4.git
$ cd archey4/
$ chmod +x archey
# Fetch latest changes (update your local version)
$ git pull
$ sudo cp archey /usr/local/bin/archey
```

## Usage

```shell
$ archey
```

## Configuration (optional)

Since the version 1.4.0, Archey 4 **may** be "tweaked" a bit with external configuration.  
You can place a [`config.json`](config.json) file in these locations :

1. `./config.json` (beside the script itself)
2. `~/.config/archey4/config.json` (in your home directory)
3. `/etc/archey4/config.json`

If an option is defined in multiple places, it will be overridden according to the order above (local preferences > user preferences > system preferences).

## Notes to users

* If you run `archey` as root, the script will list the processes running by other users on your system in order to display correctly **Window Manager** & **Desktop Environment** outputs.

* During the setup procedure, I advised you to copy this script into the `/usr/local/bin/` folder, you may want to check what it does beforehand.

* If you experience any trouble during installation or usage, please do **[open an issue](https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/archey4/issues/new)**.

* If you had to adapt the script to make it working with your system, please **[open a pull request](https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/archey4/pulls)** so as to share your modifications with the rest of the world and participate in this project !
